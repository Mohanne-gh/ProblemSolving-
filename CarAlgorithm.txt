Step 1: Write down for both cars:
Price
miles per gallon

Step 2: 
Gas is $4 per gallon
You drive 15,000 miles each year
You keep the car for 10 years

Step 3: Do this for each car:
-Divide 15,000 by miles per gallon → This tells you how many gallons it uses per year
- Multiply that number by 4 → This is the yearly fuel cost
-Multiply that by 10 → This is the 10-year fuel cost
-Add the car's price → This is the total cost of the car over 10 years

Step 4: Compare both total costs
