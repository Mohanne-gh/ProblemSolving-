1- understanding the problem
We want to print a triangle where each row has ascending and then descending numbers, and the middle number is double the previous one.

2- Analyze the Problem

The pattern is:
Start with 1
Multiply by 2 each time to get the next number in the ascending half
Then reverse it (except the last number) to get the descending half

python code:

n = int(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ascending = [1]
    
    for j in range(1, i):
        ascending.append(ascending[-1] * 2)

    full_row = ascending + ascending[-2::-1]

    for num in full_row:
        print(num, end="")
    print()
